christian says
• match extension color to nav bar
• hover to reveal delete ______ button, or at least for deleting courses, have the delete icon attatched to the same card
• '+ Add Course' button on Grade page, but lowkey u wouldnt add courses often so maybe not
• highlight/outline selecting course when user submits a file without selecting course first
• i think each course could be an entirely seperate individual white card
